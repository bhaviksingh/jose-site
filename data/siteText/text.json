My name is José Miguel / And my last name is Galán / It’s a pleasure to meet you / Thank you for this opportunity / That you’re giving me / To showcase / My talent / My rhymes come to me / But if I don’t practice they’ll be gone to me / But new ones are born / I rhyme about everything In this crazy life",
