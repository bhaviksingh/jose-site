"Hello how are you?  
My name is  
José Miguel  
And my last name is Galán  
It’s a pleasure to meet you  
Thank you for this opportunity  
That you’re giving me  
To showcase my talent  
My rhymes come to me  
But if I don’t practice  
they’ll be gone to me"

"I’m from El Salvador  
I live in California  
I’ve spent half my life  
Behind bars"  
"I’ll stay positive  
Non stop  
I love music  
But I prefer rap
I do my own thing  
I do what I have to  
To come out on top"
