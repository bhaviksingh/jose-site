**(ALWAYS READY)**  
Since I was a kid  
I’ve grown up on the streets  
Always doing what I want  
Having fun  
Leaving my life up to chance  
For some nothing is worth a damn  
Learning dirty tricks  
These are only details  
I’m telling you!  
Cause just by looking at you  
I know I can take you  
But you can try

_Chorus x2_  
Gotta stay determined  
Gotta know how to win and lose  
We’ve got more than enough reasons to

If we don’t  
It’s time wasted  
With you who aren’t worth  
a damn penny  
You feel as strong as the ocean  
And you aren’t even a river  
The weather is warm  
I’m always ready  
I’m crazy, humble and real  
In case you’re confused  
I always go hard!  
What you’ve got in spades  
Isn’t shit to me  
Whether it’s hate or appreciation  
I’ll die for what’s mine  
How about this  
You dumb bitch  
When you’re a junkie  
This life isn’t easy  
If you’re not a warrior or soldier  
Or a cold-hearted dog

_Chorus x2_
Gotta stay determined  
Gotta know how to win and lose  
We’ve got more than enough reasons to  
It’s our work every day  
In the streets in the center  
Or in the damn neighborhood  
If you don’t roll with it  
Then you’re just a chump  
That got a nickname by mistake  
I can see through you  
You’re no man  
If you’ve got shit to start with me  
You know where I live  
Better walk carefully  
Before I put a bullet in you  
Or cut you with my machete!  
You don’t reach my ankles  
You can’t even make it as a clown  
Today, tomorrow and forever  
You’re going nowhere
