**(respect)**
Listen people  
I am gonna talk straight with you all

_Chorus_  
I don’t know if you understand  
The value of respect  
For me, to earn it  
has cost me bone blood and sweat

Like any street man  
I am paying a high price  
Doing my mission  
Of which I have no regret  
The truth is  
It is only trick and talent  
And a little motivation  
To win respect  
Like any mother fucker  
Who doesn’t care about destiny  
You know where I am going  
And how I keep up  
Making easy money  
I keep myself busy  
On a fixed state  
No bug nor fellow  
Can bother me  
I watch my steps  
I watch where I am going  
I am _salvadoreño papa_
I don’t need to be high to say it  
I do it easy  
When you come  
I go
I move swiftly  
I am strong A.F.  
You are beginners  
Or a group of jokers  
That have never heard of this  
You are looking for  
What I have in excess  
Which is value and respect  
Because I have earned it  
The advice I have for you  
Is to be careful

_Chorus x 2_  
I don’t know if you understand  
The value of respect  
For me, to earn it  
has cost me bone blood and sweat

Everything in life  
Keeps its flow  
I am sure of what I do  
And who I keep by my side  
I say this with no fear  
I am sorry if my lyrics  
Cause you pain  
In the head, in the chest  
To be honest what I appreciate the most  
Is that I have earned me some respect
