Hello my name is Jose Miguel Galan Najarro\
I am 35 years old \
I am from El Salvador\
I live in San Francisco California since 2001.\
My nickname is Cholo.\
I started to write romantic and rap music after a couple of months of being in custody of juvenile hall in San Francisco California and after 5 months of arriving to California I spent over a year incarcerated due to charges that I would rather have Daniela tell you about because they embarrass me and then for mental health reasons I stopped writing music I was sent to a group home after that year or so and I was there only for one month because I did not speak English after some months I was sent to C.J.A. in 2003 for a 90 day evaluation that I did not pass so I was there only for one month because I had a flight with a gang member from the gang Bull Dog after that I was sent back to juvey in San Francisco J.J.L and after sosme months I was sentenced to 3 years in C.J.A. and I continued writing rap music that includes some foul language I came out of C.J.A. in 2006 and stopped writing music then I was free for 1 year and I had my job and all the support of my family I am single I have no kids then I was using drugs so my urine sample came out dirty so I was given a parole violation and was sentenced to 6 months of which I only did 4 for good behavior and I started writing music again but because I had no money I could not try music school then this time I was 13 months and a half and committed another crime and after a year in San Mateo County, California, I was sentenced to 10 years in prison for attempted murder with a weapon (knife) I kept writing music at times because sometimes inspiration would disappear because of how long the sentence was and because of the level programs of 3 and 4 â€“ 180 I would be busy now I have been 21 months in (immigration) detention and I started writing again romantic and rap music and thanks to my attorney I have had the opportunity to share with you my talent that I hope you like.\
One last thing I do not belong to a gang\
Thank you it really is a pleasure to have this opportunity\
Good luck to you and everybody have fun.\
