**(Introduction)**  
¿Hola cómo están?  
My name is  
José Miguel  
And my last name is Galán

_Chorus x2_  
It’s a pleasure to meet you  
Thank you for this opportunity  
That you’re giving me

To showcase  
My talent  
My rhymes come to me  
But if I don’t practice they’ll be gone to me  
But new ones are born  
I rhyme about everything In this crazy life  
Nothing can humiliate me  
Whatever comes  
We had coming  
Everybody gets  
What they deserve  
Though sometimes  
What we’ve got coming  
Turns into a song  
Since I was a little kid  
I started writing  
My own songs  
When I was in jail  
I asked myself  
How these bad impulses  
Came to control me  
I’m from El Salvador  
I live in California  
I’ve spent half my life  
Behind bars  
Remembering the past  
ontrolling my actions  
Around all kinds of people  
Criminals of course  
A bunch of motherfuckers  
I’m single  
My future is every day  
To look out for my family  
And stop fucking up  
Cause what you don’t advantage of  
You let fly away

_Chorus x2_  
It’s a pleasure to meet you  
Thank you for this opportunity  
That you’re giving me

I’ll stay positive  
Non stop  
I love music  
But I prefer rap  
I do my own thing  
I do what I have to  
To come out on top
