**(warrior of life)**  
Baby listen up  
To what I am gonna sing  
I can’t stand this place no more  
I wanna abe with you  
To be able to explain  
Detail by detail  
What I feel for you

_Chorus x2_
But in this loneliness
I can’t even laugh anymore  
It’s easier to cry

And I do not feel fine  
I ́d rather not think
I miss you so much  
That I am worthless  
Like any drunkard  
I want to hug you  
And hold you in my arms  
Kiss you from head to toe  
And say mission accomplished  
When everything is such a failure  
Why do I deserve this  
Or what am I paying  
I did not agree to this  
Why does sadness exist  
I analyze my life  
And understand you  
I have a headache  
It’s all broken to pieces  
Please forgive my actions  
But without you I am nothing  
Your presence is my happiness  
Your body my worth  
It’s not that I am a clown  
We are all owed  
And opportunity  
To correct our mistakes  
Nobody is perfect  
Even though life is a gift  
Anybody can destroy it  
When we should all be  
Warriors of life  
I am instead feeling worthless

_Chorus_
But in this loneliness  
I can’t even laugh anymore  
It’s easier to cry

It’s difficult to live healthy  
But not committing sin  
Please mommy  
Can you forgive me  
If you did not punish me  
This makes me appreciate  
And plan things better for next time  
Please pick up when I call  
Your cellphone  
I love you my love.
