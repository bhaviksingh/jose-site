**(to the women I adore)**  
This here goes out  
To all the women  
I adore  
But I have to tell you  
I’m losing my mind  
A little bit at a time

_Chorus x2_  
‘Cause we don’t understand you  
Sometimes you want everything  
Sometimes not a little bit

You work where you want  
Without worrying about us  
You don’t even want to tell us  
Just a little bit about your appetites  
You want to keep the leash short  
Ask a thousand questions  
About a little red mark  
That I had on my neck!  
She gets crazy jealous  
She wants to inspect  
Even where I pee through  
They want to control me  
From my feet to my hair  
I don’t know why this is happening  
Why make such a fuss  
Why don’t you trust me  
Or what are you afraid of  
You’re the one that’s doubting  
Fine, you can suffer  
I’m going to a party  
I’ll come back later  
Then I see her  
I ask her what’s the matter  
Trying to be sincere  
She says nothing  
Baby I love you  
This is all just some confusion  
It makes no sense  
It’s got nothing to do with anything  
Except with my desire!

_Chorus x2_
‘Cause we don’t understand you  
Sometimes you want everything  
Sometimes not a little bit

However it may be  
That’s how we are  
Savage love  
With lots of fighting  
Our thing isn’t for the church  
Our thing is from the streets  
We don’t care what people say  
We don’t give a fuck  
So good luck and see you later  
Here this chapter ends  
And a new one begins  
Good bye
