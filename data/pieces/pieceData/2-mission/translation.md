**(fulfilling the mission)**  
We are just joking around  
And the thing is burning  
All the Latinas  
Moving their hips  
Showing the world  
_Como se perrea / how it’s done_
While we enjoy  
With no shame  
Of the latin flavor  
These girls are sweet

_Chorus x2_
I don’t know how they do it  
But what I am sure of  
Is that it’s the best class  
In the area where I roll  
Decorated with diamonds

Trying my luck!  
I might be crazy, humble and real  
Until the day I die  
That is how I live comfortably  
Fake like you all  
How dream in giving me a scare  
Or get me nervous  
I enjoy my life  
With women by my side  
This is how this shit rolls  
Like any other warrior  
I am ready for the war!  
Have this clear  
Women and money come easy  
Like if we were in a fair  
And everything is tranquil  
We start with the grams  
Now we are with the kilos  
We even have strippers  
Who have their husbands all confused up Because the dumb fool does not even know  
That bodies are shared  
And he feels like all that  
Because even though she is like that  
She is the owner of his heart

_Chorus x2_  
I don’t know how they do it  
But what I am sure of  
Is that it’s the best class  
In the area where I roll  
Decorated with diamonds

I am smart  
But I am also addicted to women  
Sometimes I am high  
And with them I entertain  
Do you get it, homie?  
That’s how this thing rolls  
Latinas forever  
Fulfilling the mission  
Because I am dope  
I carry on my business  
And _warrior-ing_  
Killing the small fish  
That are in the nothing  
When I come you go  
This is how I roll  
I have no more time  
The thing is very clear
