**(everything in life)**  
_Chorus_  
Everything in life  
Happens for a reason  
Sometimes bad decisions  
Lead us to prison

Sometimes even to the tomb  
No matter what happened  
Nor when it happened  
Let’s turn the light on  
Live a straight life  
That is, a positive one  
Good things come to those who wait  
Let us enjoy life  
And live it fully  
Correct our mistakes  
Live a healthy life  
Heal our wounds  
Of the bad life  
Even though it is not perfect  
Like a survivor  
One has to keep pushing forward  
If there is no evil, we won’t be affected  
We have to keep pushing forward  
Let’s take good steps  
Even though if these are baby steps  
And think about tomorrow  
Come with a new mind  
Think positive  
We all have a right  
To live our lives  
Even though we fail  
We have to build upon our failures  
And stay in the fight  
Step by step  
Transforming into human  
Or into good beings  
Stop acting like fools

_Chorus_  
Everything in life  
Happens for a reason  
Sometimes bad decisions  
Lead us to prison

This is my truth  
Opportunity exists  
That is pure reality  
Decision is in  
What is negative and what is positive  
It is up to us which one we choose  
Depending on the reason  
Healing survival or transformation  
If you chose the negative  
You will end up in a cemetery  
Or end up thrown face down  
Why live life if you will destroy it with negativity  
Thank you and remember  
Healing, survival or transformation
