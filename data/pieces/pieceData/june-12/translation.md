**(JUNE 12, 2020)**

_Chorus x 2_  
While we are waiting  
For the Judge’s decision in Adelanto  
A lot of things are going on  
Every other day, not once in a while

Like on June 12 when we protested  
We were attacked with pepper spray  
At the beginning we did not stop  
Then the GEO guards  
Wearing black suits started spraying Pepper spray  
It all began because outside  
People were protesting  
And GEO retaliated, wanted to lock us in  
Some of us kept going  
Really, I am not kidding you  
They ended up putting us in the hole  
When we were only  
Protesting pacifically  
So they stopped punishing us  
And locking us in  
For what was happening outside  
And now because of this  
We only have 30 minutes break out of the cell  
And in that time  
We do whatever we can  
But spiritually  
We keep growing  
We do not give up  
We do not become weak  
Father nobody has ever stopped me  
Once, not even bullets could throw me down  
It makes me llllaughhhh  
Hate, jealousy and rivalry  
I pity those who carry these feelings with them  
I’d rather talk  
About how we will continue fighting

_Chorus x 2_
While we are waiting
For the Judge’s decision in Adelanto  
A lot of things are going on  
Every other day, not once in a while

Some are doing their routing exercises  
Other use the kitchen  
Others watch TV or listen to music  
Because if you do not do this or that  
Time goes slow way to slow  
Allthough some of us do not care  
Some others are complicating things  
If I am no longer a kid
I live what I live because of my mistakes  
Crying does not help at all  
If you live positively you will still come back  
To the contrary nothing is being won  
Some times life will collect its debts  
But with you, I’d rather not see  
Find the rhythm to this roll  
Goodbye!
