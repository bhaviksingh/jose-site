**(I DON’T KNOW WHAT THESE PEOPLE THIINK)**  
I don’t know what these people think  
When I made my decision  
To live the life of crime  
Like a judge I decide  
To who I sell and who I don’t  
I’ve got not office hours  
But I’m always there  
For my soldiers  
For my boss 100%  
And for my clients  
When I make my sales  
I snatch my cash up in a flash  
Sometimes I’m even dressed for church!  
I’m always loaded like a gun  
When I dress formal  
It weighs double

_Chorus x2_
When I look at the detective  
And I play the fool  
I turn the corner and run so fast  
I’m gone like an afterthought

I work on my own  
I make sure my kin  
Always have what they need  
So in the future  
They don’t pay rent  
The goal is to keep going  
To never be arrested  
To give my girl a lot of children  
To know how to use  
My intelligence  
I have a future ahead of me  
I’ve got tricks galore  
Like a thug, like a crook,  
Like a bum, or a dealer,  
Or like the gangsters  
In all these positions  
We decorate ourselves  
With women  
With guns  
Sure even with diamonds  
Every day, more and more  
like the most wanted

_Chorus x2_
When I look at the detective  
And I play the fool  
I turn the corner and run so fast  
I’m gone like an afterthought
