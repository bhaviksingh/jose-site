Hello my name is José Miguel Galán I’m 35 years old  
I come from El Salvador  
I live in California  
And my nickname is Cholo  
I’ve enjoyed writing music since a long time now.  
I started sometime around 2001, but this is the first time I have the opportunity to share my talent.  
I am detained.  
Immigration caught me and they took away my legal papers, and now I’m fighting to see if they’ll let me stay in California so I can rehabilitate myself, find a job, and keep writing my music.  
I want to make the most of this opportunity as it’s what I’ve wanted for a long time.  
I’m single, I have no children, I don’t belong to a gang, I like to exercise, have a good time, meet new people and travel to new places.  
Thank you
