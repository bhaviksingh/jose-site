**Our world will be**

To enjoy and to share  
A very fine love  
With somebody like you  
Why would I want diamonds?  
Or something temporary?  
I want something that last forever

_Chorus x 2_  
Something pure and sincere  
Or better said, something real  
I want us to be honest to each other  
Not to cause us any harm

Won’t get out of the way  
I will be a gentleman with you  
under the sun or the stars  
show you the truth which is  
that you are the most beautiful  
that is why I am foolish  
I don't want to miss  
neither your hugs nor your kisses  
I want to live in peace  
lose myself in your body  
like a lover  
a slave for you  
I won’t be a problem  
I will be patient  
I like everything about you  
you are very smart in every way  
you know how to move  
_perreas muy rico_ (I like your perreo)
you get me impatient  
I will be honest with you  
With you I don’t suffer  
With you I do right  
And for that reason I won’t fail you  
And it is also what matters  
Something that lasts forever

_Chorus x 2_  
Something pure and sincere  
Or better said, something real  
I want us to be honest to each other  
Not to cause us any harm

Everything at its own pace  
I am thankful with life  
That I have you by my side  
I hope you like
How I entertain you  
Because you are my princess  
You have it all  
You are pure beauty  
I had pretty good luck  
With you I want to be  
Even though you say leave  
And ask me to go my own way  
I want you to know  
That of you I am in love.
