**(life is hard)**  
Life is hard  
When there is no way out of this  
And you love your family

_Chorus x 2_  
My heart is bleeding  
By seeing that I am  
Losing their love  
Because I am a mother fucker

I fell once  
And here I am again  
But I will never forget  
What I always dreamt  
My dream, my goal  
Is coming close again to my mom  
And not make her ever live again  
Sadness every day  
Life is a game  
And he who does not play  
Will end up losing  
The love of their family  
Including the love of your mother  
That love that is so sweet  
You can lose it  
And you will not like it  
You can be locked up in the tank  
Or should I say the hole?  
And you won’t even realize  
That your old folks don’t respect you  
You will feel broken  
Because due to your own sweat and bones  
You lost their love  
I am so sorry buddy  
This is not cool at all  
That for our decisions  
We are here locked up  
With water up to our necks  
With a hurtful heart  
Sometimes with no reason

_Chorus x 2_  
My heart is bleeding  
By seeing that I am  
Losing their love  
Because I am a mother fucker

I am responsible  
I made this decision  
I chose this life  
You know what time it is  
And why fuck with this?  
We used to have  
And now we lack  
And I love you  
That is how life is  
Sometimes you build  
Sometimes you destroy  
But love from family  
Is always fragile
