**(Another day gone)**  
Another day gone  
While I keep thinking about  
Being with you  
I’m still most definitely  
Stuck in this shit  
That sooner or later  
Will have to change  
Whether they like it or not  
They’re going to have to let me go  
And I’ll come back to you  
To keep you warm  
When it’s cold

_Chorus x2_
I’m no diamond  
But when I’m beside you  
I shine

Remember this  
I kneel for nobody  
Not soldiers  
Not guerrillas like us  
Warriors from our hair  
To our ankles  
Our bond is stronger  
Than the waves in the ocean  
Than the current in the river  
Not even god can keep us apart  
But death is another matter  
But I’m clever  
Until death comes get me  
You’ll be my daily bread  
You’ll be my evening snack  
We don’t care  
If they don’t like it  
We’ll make love  
All the time  
Like the air we breathe  
Exhale and inhale  
Inhale and exhale  
And leave a few kids  
As our inheritance

_Chorus x2_
I’m no diamond  
But when I’m beside you  
I shine

You’re my rabbit  
And I’m your hare  
But I’m not bad bunny  
Don’t be scared  
On the contrary  
When you need lyrics  
I’ll send them to you  
Or get that fuck up on .com  
Whenever you want  
I’m also a player  
I’ll watch you later
