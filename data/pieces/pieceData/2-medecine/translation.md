**(you are my medicine)**

_Chorus x 2_  
Crazier every day  
for you  
I feel I'm not worth anything
without you  
I can't stand this pain anymore
_Mami_

come cure me suddenly  
you are my medicine  
to calm this uproar  
please understand me  
although for you I am worth little  
or I'm not worth a thing  
you are the only woman  
that has dislocated my mind  
or has it torn up in pieces  
I donâ€™t know what to do  
I need you by my side  
So that each one of us  
Returns to its place  
With no need to suffer  
And be able to be happy  
and have the reward  
to die by your side  
between celebrations  
Strive through life  
not with words  
if not with facts  
if being with you is worth so much  
I don't know why it took you so long  
to put the price on me  
I want you for me  
I'll give you the best  
you are my everything in life  
my great sincere love

_Chorus x 2_  
Crazier every day  
for you  
I feel I'm not worth anything  
without you  
I can't stand this pain anymore  
_Mami_

let's get things clear  
in this life no one is perfect  
but it hurts a lot  
to be ignored  
when a sincere love is offered  
and for simple things  
leave the unarmed  
without showing the faults  
and come to realize the problem  
and fight the fight  
without any emotion  
because what looks like two  
ends up being  
an error for one  
I love you, please come back  
I ask you to please come back
