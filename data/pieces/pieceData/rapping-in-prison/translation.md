**(RAPPING IN PRISON)**
Shit, another day  
Locked in by the fucking police  
While our families  
Pray to some God even on their knees  
Asking him to liberate us  
To help us change  
Because our children  
Will need us  
To give them advice  
Or straighten up their lives

_Chorus_
For me it was a miracle  
That I learned how to rap  
I will be able to move  
My family ahead

Not only am I saying this  
Louder than a train  
This is how I come  
With my songs  
I entertain you all  
Regardless of where they are from  
Or if they drink liquor or beer  
What I care about  
is Castilian  
The Spanish language  
We are proudly Hispanics  
We represent Latinos  
The one that stands up with permission  
We still sit them down  
If you participate or obey  
Or we will get you out  
Even lighter  
Than using the fucking dump  
The point is easy and sincere  
We look for a good life  
And an easy one  
That includes everything  
First women and money  
Then fame will come  
But while it gets here  
I drink my beer  
(redacted)

_Chorus_
For me it was a miracle  
That I learned how to rap  
I will be able to move  
My family ahead

These are my decisions  
I spent a thousand of them in prisons  
But with the music  
They will give me back a million  
Because everything is a rhyme  
I will get it for my family  
Good future for the kid  
If I am no thorn nor needle  
I donâ€™t know why I prick you  
Goodbye I come from the finest hood
