**(a dream come true)**

_Chorus x2_  
I don’t know how to explain  
All this that I am feeling  
Is like a dream come true  
Of which I have no regret

But I want to thank  
Each and every one of you  
For understanding the importance  
And for having made the time  
A par of your time  
To listen to my lyrics  
With very good sentiments  
And for giving me the chance  
Like I gave it to you  
A lot of praise and thankfulness  
Not one is lacking  
You like professionals  
Helping us  
Fight this fight  
That is not easy at all  
I try to explain to myself how to continue  
Step by step  
Going crazy  
With paper and pencil  
And living at peace  
Always pushing forward  
Never going back  
Looking to achieve my goals  
Those that can be achieved  
Because life is not easy  
And everything that we want  
We can’t always have  
Because there are things at are fragile

_Chorus x2_  
I don’t know how to explain  
All this that I am feeling  
Is like a dream come true  
Of which I have no regret

It’s not that this came out of nothing  
Whoever seeks shall find  
Thank you artists  
And my attorney  
Without whom none of this would be happening  
Not even a bit  
Now its my turn  
To seize this chance  
With my crazy flow  
Because things are trembling  
Let’s go on it hard  
Because this is who I am  
Nobody is asking this of me  
You can’t find it at the shop  
For your personal use  
I was born with this  
Thank you  
And please have fun  
I am Jose Galan
