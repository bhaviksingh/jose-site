**(standing in the corner)**
Another day I am going mad  
Standing in the corner  
Throwing my word out  
To the ladies passing by  
And running my business  
Outside of the cantina  
Drinking my beer  
With the cop in front of me

_Chorus_
I am taking it easy  
But when I am on  
I am making easy money  
For unknown reasons in life

We have to survive  
And we have to joke around  
When you hear the bullet you know  
Someone is being taken down  
Probably by their enemies  
That are thinking “we did it”  
In broad daylight  
For any one of these there will be another family  
That will have to kneel down  
To pray  
And read the bible  
And say this ain’t fair  
That they took away his life  
This is tough stuff  
It can happen to anybody  
If you have bad luck  
I saw it all, but I don’t know a thing  
The people I know tell me  
Go home  
Something can happen to you  
But I am only doing my thing  
In this place that is also mine  
Well this is how it rolls  
Even though I am just hustling  
And smoking a joint  
What is the worst that can happen?  
That I be arrested  
For being a dumbass  
Standing in the corner!

_Chorus_
I am taking it easy  
But when I am on  
I am making easy money  
For unknown reasons in life

I have no other action  
But lose today’s money  
Keep following the mission  
Is what I prefer  
I don’t get in nobody’s business  
I am only making money  
To no fault of my own  
But that is how life is  
Like any other mad man  
I also crossed the line.
