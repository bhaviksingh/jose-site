**(Just a rhyme about healing, surviving and transformation)**

Since I was a young kid  
I have not been afraid of anything  
I have done what I want  
I have always liked to party  
I don’t know why  
I say it even if I don’t want to say it  
Because I know I have hurt  
People I love  
Not because I wanted to  
But at this point  
Better to get better or to find a way  
To heal  
To keep on living  
And to be in a good position  
The truth is that  
There are many of us  
With a confused mind  
Making day by day  
The wound bigger that we caused  
To those that love us  
We should better look for a way out  
There is no such thing as perfect  
When you are trying to survive  
But there is a reason  
Like any other winner  
We have the right  
To keep moving forward  
And to look for forgiveness  
To think positive  
To obtain transformation  
And to keep walking straight  
To use our experiences  
That have their own faults  
If being good is what you strive for  
You have to look for goodness  
It will not be there standing for you  
This is nothing new  
We have to plan the positive things  
So that we find them again  
Because to the contrary  
Everything will stay ugly  
And you won’t move forward  
Life’s destiny  
Could be death itself  
And if death gets here  
There is no going back  
From rhyme to rhyme  
I can tell you more  
Healing in forgiveness  
Survival in achieving  
Transformation in creation  
With these three words  
I will be a champion  
This is only a rhyme  
This is not a song
