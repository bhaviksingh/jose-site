_(ANOTHER IDENTICAL DAY OF THE WEEK)_  
Another identical day of the week  
But in a different year  
Living with my cellies  
In this they call the cell  
Or rather, the dump  
But nothing gets me down  
I do my cleaning every day  
(redacted)  
You know how this rolls  
Then I do some programing  
And hustle a little for the money  
With our peoples  
Marching to the striking orders of the boss  
Fearless  
If they need anything from us  
We are Central American  
Or Mexican  
Hispanic Latinos  
United Peoples  
Helping each other out  
Whenever we can  
We drink the famous pruno  
(redacted)  
(redacted)  
The smoke became a cloud  
And like a cloud of rain  
That’s how it all remains

_Chorus x 2_  
That’s the life of every prisoner  
If you have it in you, you will learn how to  
Get rid of fear

Here nobody whines  
You live day by day  
Always to the contrary  
Of the guards or the police  
But sometimes we do make use of them  
To bring us our stuff to use the phones  
Or whatever we need  
If anything fails  
We go hard and bring them down  
Specially if they are white  
Or any fucking American  
I do not operate, I am no surgeon  
But if necessary, we will stick it to them  
We do it missionary style  
The boss has the last word  
And we need to respect  
Here, almost anything goes  
Except for mother fuckers  
Or shitty soldiers  
If you think it twice  
You will not survive

_Chorus x 2_  
That’s the life of every prisoner  
If you have it in you, you will learn how to  
Get rid of fear
