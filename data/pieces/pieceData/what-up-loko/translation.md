**(WHAT UP LOKO)**  
What up loko  
Playing the game every day  
In the county in the district  
In the city in the street  
Or in the hood  
Keeping it honest  
I’m everywhere  
In freedom or in prison  
Standing tall  
Always on the mission  
To get money power and respect  
For whatever motive  
And whatever reason  
No mercy for no reason  
On the competition  
Or we send them to the graveyard  
If we can’t sort it with words  
We’ll fix it with weapons  
It don’t matter  
It’s just a soldier  
Not the whole damn battalion

_Chorus x2_
I’m a thug  
Dangerous
And tough

I’ve suffered  
I come from the bottom  
I earn or I take  
What I can  
I don’t give a fuck  
About life  
I party hard  
And I work harder  
Women and bitches  
I take off their clothes  
And then we fuck  
You know the motion  
From up to down  
From inside to out  
Like playing _capirucho_  
With your vagina  
No rules  
Haters shut your mouth  
Either your breath or your words  
Are attracting flies  
Cause they’re just shit  
Better fight  
Keep surviving  
Twenty four seven ready  
If a war is on the way  
Like a warrior I’ll be training  
To become a champion

_Chorus x2_
I’m a thug  
Dangerous  
And tough
