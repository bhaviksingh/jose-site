**(Hello my love)**  
Hello my love  
Let me tell you  
You’re the greatest thing  
That exists for me  
In this life  
It was a surprise  
From the first day I saw you  
I even asked myself

_Chorus x2_
How or why can someone  
So beautiful  
Exist

As long as I have you  
Close or in my sight  
Touching my lips  
You put a smile  
On my lips  
I’m not surprised  
That you did  
I must be dreaming  
Or living in the moment  
It’s a scientific fact  
Love and hate  
Come looking for me  
When they don’t  
Come for anyone else  
Am I crazy  
Or how did I manage  
For death not to come for me  
Can it be that god exists  
Or is it some street miracle  
I want money power and respect  
Everything is earned in the hood  
You gotta know how to live life  
Everything has its entrance  
But some things  
Don’t have an exit  
But we’re always ready  
Baby I’m cold  
Come keep me warm  
I can read your gaze  
And I know that you want me  
I look like a bird  
When I’m really a rooster  
And for the haters  
What good are your weapons  
If you don’t have enough  
For bullets  
So  
What’s the fucking joke  
Why are you fucking with me  
Everybody gets  
What they deserve  
Meanwhile me and her  
What do you care  
If we’re together  
Or if we’re friends  
I know you felt it

_Chorus x2_  
How or why can someone  
So beautiful  
Exist

If you keep asking  
Stupid haters  
When will this end  
When it’s only beginning  
Keep your envy
And your damn jealousy I couldn’t give a fuck  
About your bragging  
So about our love  
Don’t even start  
I’m the good guy here  
Stay hungry  
And dream on
