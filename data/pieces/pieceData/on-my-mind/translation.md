**(You’re always on my mind)**  
You’re always on my mind  
What can I tell you  
Although you’re not  
Beside me  
It doesn’t mean  
You stopped existing  
Only time has separated us  
So we can reflect  
Realize and value  
Our relationship

_Chorus x2_  
To destroy the negative  
and build something positive  
so please  
stop arguing

I have a right  
To enjoy  
But not to share  
Because I respect you  
But if I fail you  
Drop on me like a Karate chop  
Spin kick me in the chest  
Cause if I fail you  
I’ll accept  
With no excuses  
That I hurt you  
I don’t lie about those things  
I don’t play dumb  
I think the world of you  
And I don’t believe you  
That you don’t want me anymore  
You just say it  
But you don’t believe it  
Love does exist  
It’s just a matter of understanding  
what love is  
what pleasure is  
there’s a world of difference  
for me as a man  
and for you as a woman  
I want to tell you again

_Chorus x2_
To destroy the negative  
and build something positive  
so please  
stop arguing

Let’s keep winning  
Two heads will think  
Better than just one  
Get rid of your jealousy  
Let’s keep relating  
Without sharing with anyone  
You know what I’m talking about  
I’m not playing  
A lot of kisses  
Full of love  
I want  
To give you  
Even now I still love you
