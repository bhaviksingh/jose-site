**(how life is)**  
What is life like?  
The truth is  
It is very beautiful  
Sometimes life puts us tests  
That are dangerous  
Different for all of us  
That is how things are  
Everybody at different times!  
We don’t lose anything by trying  
The problems or experiments  
That life brings us  
Except for the stories

_Chorus x2_  
You learn how to live  
Little by little  
Nobody is born knowing it all  
Not even the slightest thing

And we keep pushing forward  
While time speeds before us  
Without stopping for an instant  
And without expecting nothing from anybody  
And there is no calm medication  
That will make time stop  
Nor the biggest act  
Of the evilest man will make it stop  
It’s easier to lose life  
Of that there is a lot of proof in life  
A lot of acts  
And a lot of craziness  
Some of them have a price  
And there are a lot of mad men with determination  
Ready to take on it  
Doing it costs them nothing  
It’s not something new  
Life has it all  
In its existence  
Even though sooner or later  
We will die

_Chorus x2_  
You learn how to live  
Little by little  
Nobody is born knowing it all  
Not even the slightest thing

Some of us  
Have to feel the pain  
Some others  
Don’t see sun light again  
And those of us that are still alive  
We are just here waiting for the best  
For us and for others  
And to every problem  
Let’s look for forgiveness  
The bad thing about life is death  
Or that when it gets here  
There is no salvation  
But even with that –life is beautiful  
This comes from the heart  
Thank you everybody  
I wish you the best
