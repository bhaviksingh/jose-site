_(the family you were looking for)_  
What’s up man  
I see you Representing  
Gaining respect  
All tattooed up  
For love of the game  
You are all ready

_Chorus x 2_  
It’s like the family  
That you were looking for  
And you found

For them you give it all  
Ready for the war  
With pride  
You are filed with courage  
And you won’t let yourself be brought down  
Because you know the way  
And their baggage is fake  
All bark and no bite  
No drugs nor hallucinations  
You can see the fear in them  
Without ammunition you can beat em  
Every mind is different  
Do not even give them details  
In this life he who wants  
Always stands out  
Respect to the cheros  
And to the street guys  
Everybody else, just leave  
You are all having a hard time  
But you keep moving forward  
Trying to make things happen  
Whom who seeks finds  
The thing is, you gotta try

_Chorus x 2_  
It’s like the family  
That you were looking for  
And you found

Everything goes by so fast  
Like anything that is triumphant  
Drugs, money, women  
A whole lotta mess  
With no painkillers  
Rules come first  
With many participants  
Dangerous weapons  
Always ready for combat  
If they tell you were you are from  
You should know to represent  
Like a missionary  
With entertainment  
Give it all  
Long live la raza  
Long live rampage
