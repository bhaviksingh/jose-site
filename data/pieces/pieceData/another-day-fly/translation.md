**(ANOTHER DAY THAT WILL FLY BY LIKE ANY OTHER)**  
Another day  
That will fly by like any other  
I am imprisoned  
Completely fucked up  
But like a soldier
Ready for the war  
Many say that life is not easy  
Well that’s what they make of it  
Or how they complicate it  
Those that like it that day  
Meanwhile I hustle  
And in the action, I get the money  
Without expecting anybody’s support  
Except from my family and my friends

_Chorus x 2)_  
While my character gets stronger  
Thanks to your jealousy  
And your envy  
But above all  
To your fucking hate

I will stay at ease  
Drinking my drink  
Smoking some puffs  
Possibility with your girl by my side  
Saying, Oh my god  
With this man here  
There will be no other man that makes me wetter  
Nor any other that I like better  
When he talks  
I listen  
If they do not  
It’s because he is (redacted)
He says bitch  
Its your time our mine  
Let’s play _capirucho_  
With all in  
That this bed  
Will not be a witness  
You know well I appreciate you!  
Like a gift  
I will come  
(redacted)  
Like a playboy  
When you are barely on your way  
I am already coming back  
Destroy or be destroyed  
Let’s get the money and the fame  
Then the rest will fall  
Your mother your woman your cousin or your sister  
All this is all the roll!

_Chorus x 3_  
While my character gets stronger  
Thanks to your jealousy  
And your envy  
But above all  
To your fucking hate

After the final chorus more flow!
