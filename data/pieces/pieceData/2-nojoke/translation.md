**(this is no joke)**  
Like I will tell you  
To those that I confide in  
That I feel weird  
Even though I am a fine rooster  
I give my life on the streets  
And I don’t think what I say  
I like to party  
100%  
And I got them all beaten up  
They don’t like what I do

_Chorus x2_  
Life is like a match  
Where you win and lose  
This is what I learned  
One becomes a warrior  
One is not born one

And it is not perfect either  
Him who lives hard  
Dies hard  
Even tho the cemetery is full and at capacity  
Have no doubt about this  
One needs to become a guerrillero  
Until you make it to the tomb  
It’s not that I don’t value life  
I like what is easy  
And I am also thankful  
For the love to my family  
For it keeps me at bay  
For them I die  
And for those that are there with me  
Listen up, I am no delinquent  
Every day of the week  
I will be present with my people  
Ready for the battle  
Its not that I am confused  
Or that I don’t know what I want

_Chorus x2_  
Life is like a match  
Where you win and lose  
This is what I learned  
One becomes a warrior  
One is not born one

This is almost like studying  
Even though if by mistake  
They fuck us over  
Even though life is short  
We have to live day by day  
If tomorrow is not here yet  
Then why do we care  
We better keep moving forward  
If paradise or hell awaits us  
I don’t give a damn  
Where I will end up  
You ain’t got nothing on me I can teach you  
So you don’t waste your time My actions say it all  
This is no joke
