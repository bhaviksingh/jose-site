**(I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I CAME (TO THE UNITED STATES)**
I remember the first time I came  
I was feeling so good  
That I was coming to make money (in English)  
To the United States (in Spanish)  
I had it all planned out  
Even though I was really young (in English)  
Because thanks to my family  
I had my own green card  
So I was flying in a plane (in English, in a “plain”)  
A little later shit went down  
And I ended up un C.Y.A.  
I was doing my thing (in English)  
I was doing my thing  
On the street  
I violated parole  
And again, they found me guilty of a new case (in English)  
And I ended up in prison

_Chorus x 2_
Paying a lot of bullets (in English)  
Paying a lot of bullets  
But my messed-up life  
Is not over yet (in English, “not over yeat”)  
Is still not over yet

I keep working  
With the ho’s and the money  
I’m gonna be enjoying freedom  
Having a great time  
In the state of California  
From San Francisco to LA  
Where there are many homies  
Doing it big (in English)  
And with a lot of respect  
If you think you will reveal  
They will put you  
the one-eighty-seven  
And they will make sure  
That you don’t come out alive  
Even that they need clients to make money (in English)  
Your stupid ass (in English)  
Has nothing  
Except your death  
It will be like a joke  
It will be something funny  
And your family is a failure  
Because they killed another joker  
Don’t know if I will be arrested  
Or if this time I’ll go free  
I was born for the business  
And with ours we are top notch  
Living the bad life  
And with the bitches  
We play with them assess

_Chorus x 2_
Paying a lot of bullets (in English)  
Paying a lot of bullets  
But my messed up life  
Is not over yet (in English, “not over yeat”)  
Is still not over yet

CRAZY HUMBLE AND REAL
