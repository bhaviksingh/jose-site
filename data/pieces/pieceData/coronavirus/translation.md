**(CORONAVIRUS)**  
What’s wrong with the world  
We are worried  
While coronavirus says  
I will bring down anybody  
I have no education  
I’ve been dragging since I was a newborn  
Even the most veteran  
It doesn’t matter if they are shitty  
Or if all their lives they given a helping hand  
_Chorus x 2_  
But what I need to tell you about the virus  
That some of you may have felt the symptoms  
And others have not even realized it

I am the ghost  
And I have the whole world in a panic  
There are some good soldiers  
That not even the quarantine  
Has stopped them from doing their hustle  
But COVID-19  
Has empowered me  
So many scientists or drugs  
That not even pi si pi has knocked me down  
I make no appointments  
But others  
With their physical contact  
Or their protective work gear  
From one to another they have sent me  
It came here, gratuitously  
I have spread everywhere  
Not even fucking Bayer  
Has put a stop to it
I prefer not to stand till  
With all the tools  
And heavy artillery I have with me  
I got something planned  
I’d better cause an explosion  
While COVID-19  
Is still on high alert  
I can only tell you  
Take shelter  
Because I can torture you  
For days nonstop  
I am not like the bullets  
So be careful  
_Chorus x 2_  
But what I need to tell you about the virus  
That some of you may have felt the symptoms  
And others have not even realized it  
I only do my work  
That is keep on killin’  
I do not do it for hire nor for pay  
Instead of being sad  
Take a line  
Or a fun drink
