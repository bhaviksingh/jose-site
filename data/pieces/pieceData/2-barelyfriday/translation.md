**(it’s barely Friday)**

How’s everybody doing  
Another week goes by  
Now it’s Friday

_Chorus x2_  
Let’s enjoy the party until Sunday  
That is the day after tomorrow  
The ladies are ready
They want some _perreo_

Grab your drinks
Remember w
This is a great party
All music will be playing
Rap, romantic and reggaeton  
Everything in the system
Dance with whomever you want  
With Latinas, Asian  
Blonde or brown  
Don’t think it weird  
Profession don’t matter  
If you are street guy, laborer, lawyer  
For everybody there is a party  
Remember its barely Friday  
So this is just starting  
To get flavor  
Hello to everybody present  
No matter where you come from  
What you represent  
Here we have a little bit of everywhere  
But no yuppies  
Nor those with a weird step  
Single men single women  
Let’s continue motivating  
Because having fun is no crime  
So enjoy yourself

_Chorus x2_  
Let’s enjoy the party until Sunday  
That is the day after tomorrow  
The ladies are ready  
They want some perreo

With no delicacy  
The pure flavor of mambo  
Although on Monday  
We will have a headache  
That is the cost  
Of taking a drink  
Or drinking a couple of beers  
Although it does not matter  
Let us enjoy life  
Because life is short  
Time passes lightly  
For that I also work  
Not only to pay the bills  
Or for those I love  
I say it with intention  
Today is Friday  
Let’s enjoy the party until Sunday  
That is the day after tomorrow
