**(I am not a rapper)**  
I am not a rapper  
Nor do I know how to sing  
The only thing I do  
Is combine letters with letters  
That rhyme with the sounds  
At the same speed  
That is how I compose  
What I feel, think  
Or what I do  
With the same tone  
And obtain an expression  
Of what has been, what is and will be  
With not need of cutting them  
That is all together or in a string  
I keep my mind active  
And give the message is what I strive  
From beginning to end  
With few but clear words  
With you as my support  
Which is of great help to me  
To create the talent  
That is how it rolls  
And there is no difficulty  
Its just the use of mind  
Based on a theme  
I think thatâ€™s it  
I will keep rhyming for you all  
In summer, winter, spring or fall.
